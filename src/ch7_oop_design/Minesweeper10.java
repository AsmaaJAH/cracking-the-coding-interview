/*
 7.1 O Minesweeper: Design and implement a text-based Minesweeper game. Minesweeper is the classic
single-player computer game where an NxN grid has B mines (or bombs) hidden across the grid. The
remaining cells are either blank or have a number behind them. The numbers reflect the number of
bombs in the surrounding eight cells. The user then uncovers a cell. If it is a bomb, the player loses.
If it is a number, the number is exposed. If it is a blank cell, this cell and all adjacent blank cells (up to
and including the surrounding numeric cells) are exposed. The player wins when all non-bomb cells
are exposed. The player can also flag certain places as potential bombs. This doesn't affect game
play, other than to block the user from accidentally clicking a cell that is thought to have a bomb.
(Tip for the reader: if you're not familiar with this game, please play a few rounds on line first.)
